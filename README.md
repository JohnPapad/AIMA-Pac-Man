## [ Part 1: Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu./search.html)

In this part, the *Pac-Man* agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. General search algorithms were built and applied to *Pac-Man* scenarios.

A makefile is provided. You can use the command ```$ make ``` for auto-grading and ```$ make clean``` to delete all generated *.pyc* files.

You can also check the full list of available commands in the [commands.txt](./search/commands.txt) file.

- [search.py](./search/search.py) : Where all the search algorithms reside.
- [searchAgents.py](./search/searchAgents.py) : Where all the search-based agents reside.
